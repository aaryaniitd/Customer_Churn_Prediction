# Customer_Churn_Prediction
To predict whether a customer will stay at a place permanently or not depending on various factors.


I cleaned the data, which is a major part of this code, using pandas and numpy inbuilt methods.

Then I converted data into numerical format for the neural network (which will implement) to work.

After that data is split into training and testing part.

I used Keras from Tensorflow to implement the Neural Network, I kept the number of epochs low at the time of commiting the code file.

Finally, the result of the NN was condensed to a simple python array.
